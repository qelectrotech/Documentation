A "name" for the project created can be given in the ``Project Title`` field of ``Project properties``. Click ``Projects`` from main menu to access these options. The project title tab now displays the project name as ``Project "name" [modified]``. The project should now be saved as a file `file\_\name.qet`, the project title tab then displays ``project "name"``. A project can have this "name" different from the name of the file as which it is saved. Alternatively, a project which acquires its name from the file name can be overwritten by this action. The ``Project properties`` window has several options to be set. Such options are applied to all subsequent drawings added to the project. The present drawing properties should be set from the ``Diagram properties`` option in the tool bar or by double left clicking the drawing tab. Project properties window is further explained under `Project properties`_.
