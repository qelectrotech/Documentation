QElectroTech as E-CAE tool
==========================

Before learning QET, explaining the difference between Computer Aided Design (CAD) and 
Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) is necessary. To take full potential of QET the user should 
understand the difference between both type of tools.

A CAD tool is a modern tecnology created to design and generate technical documentation. It is 
a tool which replaces manual drafting with automated actions that should be executed by a 
computer according the user orders. Considering that QET is a 2D tool, a 2D CAD tool can be 
used to create geometric vector entities such as points, lines, arcs and polygons. 

A CAE tool is a step beyond traditional CAD tools. A CAE software is the integration of a 
CAD tool and something else in a tool. That something else can be an analysis tools, data 
base, product data management, etc. The aim of a CAE tool in front of a CAD tool is the 
reduction of engineering and maintenace costs.  

QET is an Electrical Computer Aided Engineering (E-CAE) tools. It has been created combinating 
a CAD tool that allows the creation of schemas and diagrams; and databases such projects and 
collection of elements, conduits, I/O signals, etc.

An E-CAE software fosters inter-disciplinary collaboration between automation, electrical, fluid 
power and process control engineering. This means that despite QET has been designed for the 
electrical, electronics, automation and control fiels, QET is also a good solution for fluid 
engineering and many different type of diagrams.

Once the diference between CAD and CAE has been explanined, knowing that QET is something more 
that a tool for drafting schemas is obvious. This section is not explaining every concept, this 
will be described later. Nevertheles, knowing that using QET is also the definition of an active 
working database, project, and different collections of objects can be learned at this section.
