Overview
~~~~~~~~

QElectrotec is a modern open source Electrical Computer-Aided Engineering 
(E-CAE) software. QElectrotech is a combination of a traditional computer-aided 
drafting (CAD) software and a powerful central database, libraries and projects. The 
software has been oriented to the electrical engineering, QElectroTech is the correct 
tool for electrical, electronic, automation and control circuits. As CAE 
software, QElectrotech has the ability to support more than one discipline. 
QElectroTech is also a good tool for hydraulic, pneumatic and central lubrication
shemas as well as Process and Instrumentation Diagrams (PID) and many other type of 
diagrams.

QElectroTech is fully multi-platform. It currently runs flawlessly on Windows, 
Linux/Unix and Mac OSX without any difference on look and functionality 
between each platforms.

QElectroTech is a multi-languaje tool which has already been translated to many different 
languajes as English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, etc.

QElectroTech is more than a tool to create primarily, electrical, electronics, 
automation and control circuits; fluid schemes and diagrams. QElectrotech is also a 
tool which defines the way how should be the workflow to develop a project in 
an efficient way. QElectroTech is a tool that should be used during the pre-design, 
design, manufacturing and maintenace phase of a product or installation.

Working in QElectroTech is based on projects. A project is a database which includes 
the created schemas, pages and reports, and all necessary data such master data, 
plot frames, symbols, parts data, and forms.

QElectroTech allows the user to export all schemas and reports to various formats like 
dxf, pdf, jpg, png, etc.

The benefit of QElectroTech in front of comercial E-CAE tools from the market is the 
large community of programers, enthusiasts and users worldwide that are using their 
free time to participate on the project; it is an open source project. QElectroTech is 
fundamentally a social project where everybody is welcome to participate.  

To who is QElectroTech address?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QElectroTech is an open source software which can be used, distributed, copied and 
modified by everyone. QElectroTech is addresed to:

* Hobbists of electricity, electronics, automation and control.
* Hobbists of hydraulic and penumatic systems.
* Everybody interested on creating diagrams in a way that others open source softwares (Ex. Dia) is not covering.
* Startups which do not have the economical capacity to pay the license costs of comercial E-CAE softwares.
* Companies which do not want to pay the license costs of comercial E-CAE softwares.
