I/O Signal
===================================

The I/O signal is still not developed inside QElectroTech, actually the user can create it as element, see element editor.

For the representation is not a problem, the actual disadvantage is that the software cannot separate signals 
from element and they will appear mixed at the summary. QElectroTech is still not able to create in an easy and automatic way
the three different summaries necessary at domotic or industrial control: Elements, cables/connectors and I/O list.
