Page or diagram
===================================

By default, QElectroTech opens an `Untitled` diagram under an `Untitled project` when a new project is created (refer `Section.2`_). A new diagram can also be created by pressing ``Control + t`` keys from keyboard or by clicking the ``add a diagram`` button |newdrawing| located rightmost on the ``diagram title bar`` or by selecting the ``add a diagram`` from the ``Project`` option on the main menu bar. The drawing name and other properties can be set by invoking ``Diagram properties`` button from the tool bar. The ``Diagram properties`` can also be launched from the menu bar ``Edit`` and selecting the ``Diagram properties`` or by pressing ``Control + L`` keys from the key board. The diagram properties window has options to assign a name to the diagram, author's name, date, changing the dimensions of the work area by adjusting number and dimensions of rows and columns, or selecting a standard template for the drawing etc.,. There is a custom tab provided for user defined keys.
