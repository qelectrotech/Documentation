Element
===================================

QElectroTech has a number of elements listed as a tree under ``QET Collection`` in the left pane of main window. The collection of elements (shown highlighted in yellow square in `Fig.1`_) is organized under relevant categories (folders). Users can click on the ``+`` symbol located left to the category to surf the elements or more categories under its tree. Alternatively an element can be searched quickly using ``Filter`` field, refer to filter_.  Each element can be selected using left mouse click and drag dropped on to the work area to include it in a diagram. The elements can be positioned any where in the work area. Some of the tools in the tool bar apply to elements such as cut, copy, paste, delete, rotate, element properties and select tools. Refer to |elmttools| from tool bar.
Some of the operations possible with elements:

   (1) **Cut and Paste** 

      (a) Elements can be cut paste by using the `scissors' icon and `Paste' icon from the the tool bar.
      (b) Standard keyboard shortcuts like ``Control+x`` will also cut the element and ``Control+ v`` will paste the element.
      (c) Restrict the cut and paste functions within the same project. The elements would suffer data loss if the operations are effected over more than one project.

   (2) **Copy**

      (a) Elements can be copied by clicking the "Copy" icon from the tool bar or using ``Control+ c`` from the keyboard. Copied elements can be pasted in the same drawing or another drawing of the same Project. Pasting into a new project may cause loss of data. 
      (b) *Always use add an element (drag dropping into drawing) for new projects.*


   (3) **Delete** 

       (a) Added elements can be deleted by selecting the element with a left mouse click and pressing either ``Delete`` key from keyboard or clicking the delete tool in the tool bar.
       (b) It is possible to *Delete* more than one elements at a time by selecting them and applying delete option. Refer to `Selection properties`_ to know how to select more than one element.

   (4) **Rotating**
      
       (a) Rotation of elements can be performed by selecting the element in the work area with left mouse click and pressing ``space`` key from key board. 
       (b) Elements can be rotated in quantum steps of 90\ :sup:`o`\  (degrees). 
       (c) Rotate option in the tool bar turns active upon selecting at least one element in work area, which can be clicked to orient the selected element(s) to the required rotation. 
       (d) A number of elements can be selected together by holding ``control`` key from key board and left clicking required number of elements in the work area. Once the required elements are selected (evident from light gray box enclosing each selected element), rotation operation can now be performed on all the selected elements together as described earlier. Some elements like for example, a horizontal ammeter that cannot be rotated for obvious reasons.

.. _Selection properties:
   
   (5) **Selection properties**

       (a) Clicking the `Selection properties' tool will pop open a properties window for the selected element. 
       (b) At a time more than one element can be selected either by holding ``Control`` key from keyboard and selecting each element by left clicking it with mouse or by clicking a point in the workspace, holding it and dragging a selection square encompassing the elements to be selected. 
       (c) When more than one element is selected, the selection properties window will have no options. Or in otherwords the software will not permit defining properties for a collection of elements simultaneously. It has to be done element by element.
