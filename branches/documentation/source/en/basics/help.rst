Tooltips
~~~~~~~~

toolbars is displayed when the mouse arrow is placed on it. A tooltip is a short message 
which defines the action corresponding to the icon. 

QElectroTech also allows the display from tooltips, or short descrition panels, at many different 
areas and objets that appears at the main window. These panels are not diplayed automatically with 
the placement of the mouse arrow on the object or area.
