Single line conductor
=====================

The single line conductor is often used at `Single line diagrams <../../../en/folio/type/singlelinediagram.html>`_. 
QElectroTech represents a single line conductor as a simple line with an overlapping symbol which can 
be costumized. 

QelectorTech does not allow defining any property from single line codncutor. The single line 
condusctors do not have the posibility of linking any text.
