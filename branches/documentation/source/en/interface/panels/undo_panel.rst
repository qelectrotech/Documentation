The undo panel is used to return to the status after one of the action made after last save. By one 
click on one of the actions listed at undo panel, the project will return to the status after the 
action choosed at the panel. While the project is not saved again, the user can go to the different 
status as many times he wants.

.. warning::

    If you play with the panel, be sure that you are at the correct history status before continue working, 
    saving project or any irreversible action like delete folio. Once the project is saved or an 
    irreversible action is made, the history is deleted.

    * Checking the project many steps before.
    * Etc.
