To be sure that any object is selected before any action, QElectroTech provides the option to unselect 
all objects from the workspace. This option is useful for avoiding undesired changes such as the 
properties from an element.

The Unselection of all elements can only be done from the Menu bar. 

    1. Select **Edit > Select none** to unselect all selected object.
