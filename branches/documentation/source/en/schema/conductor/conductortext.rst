Define text at conductor
========================

QElectroTech allows difining and display information text at each conductor. 

.. note::

   Only multiline conductor type allows text definition.

For defining the conductor text:

    1. Select conductor which should be edited. 
    2. `Display conductor properties <../../conductor/properties/displayconductorproperties.html>`_ PopUp window.
    3. Go to the multiline section of the **Type** tab.

        .. figure:: graphics/qet_conductor_multiline_text.png
            :align: center

    4. Choose the desired parametes for text positioning, text content or formula, text size, etc.
    5. Choose if the changes should be saved for the conductor selected or also for the rest of conductors with the same potential, conductors with common initial or end terminal.
    6. Press **OK** Button to save and apply the property changes.
