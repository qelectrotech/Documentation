===================
Change element size
===================

QElectroTech provide the feature of changing the size of the graphical symbol from an `element`_. 
This feature is equivalent to the scale feature from CAD tools and graphical vector editors.

.. note::

    The current version from QElectroTech, version 0.7, does not provide the option of defining the 
    proportion to scale.

To changee the size from element symbol:

    1. Open the `element`_ desired using the `element editor`_.
    2. `Select all element parts`_ from `workspace`_.
    3. Press one of the control points from the global element symbol rectangle (green points from the figure).

        .. figure:: graphics/qet_element_change_size.png
            :align: center

    4. Move the point without releasing the left button of the mouse.
    5. Once the element symbol has been scaled, `save changes`_ and `close element editor`_.
