Steps to create an element
==========================

Grafical representation definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The grafical representation of an element is a group of graphical elements (line, rectangle, ellipse, 
arc, polygon, terminal, arc, text and dynamic text field). At QElectroTech, these graphical elements 
are known as parts.

The graphical symbol creation procedure consists on the introduction and placement of the different parts 
at the workspace from the element editor. 

During the schema creation, QElectroTech treats an element as a block which reference point is the origin 
defined in the element editor.

For more information about how to work with parts at the grafical area from the element editor, please 
refers to the **Working with parts** section.


Element data definition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An element contains a small database with some information that is used by QElectroTech to allow the user 
managing projects and creating reports. The information fields from the database are pre-defined by QElectroTech 
depending on the element family asigned by the user, the user can only fill the content from the database 
fiels. New fields cannot be added to the element database.

The element database has two different type of information from the element, the element name in all desired 
languages by the user and the element properties as article number, manufacturer, supplier, etc.

name** section.
