Display project properties
==============================

The `project properties`_ can be displayed at a PopUP window from `Menu bar`_ and `projects panel`_.

Project properties from Menu bar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    1. Select **Project > Project properties** menu item to display the `project properties`_ PopUP window from the active project.

.. warning::

    If more than one `projects`_ is opened, be sure that the active `projects`_ is the correct before 
    changing properties. 

Project properties from project panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The advantage of displaying the `project properties`_ from the `projects panel`_ is the posibility 
to choose `projects`_ which are opened and are not the active `project`_.

    1. Right click on one project from the project tree of the `projects panel`_.
    2. Select **Project properties** to display the `project properties`_ PopUP window.

   If the `projects panel`_ is not displayed, it can be displayed from **Settings > Display > Projects**.
