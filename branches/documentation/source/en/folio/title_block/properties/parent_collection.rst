Title block parent collection
=============================

The parent collection property from a `title block`_ defines the `title block collection`_ to which the 
`title block`_ belongs. 

This property defines the rights from the user to `edit the title block`_. A `title block`_ with 
`QET title block collection`_ as parent collection can only be read by the user. A `title block`_ with 
`User title block collection`_ or `Project title block collection`_ as parent collection can be read 
and writed (`edited`_) by the user.

The parent collection from a `title block`_ can be defined during the `save process`_.
