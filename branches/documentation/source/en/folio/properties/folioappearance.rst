be used at the folio. The user can pre-define the appearence from all conductors that later on will 
be created inside the folio. This pre-definition avoid defining the appearence conductor one by one
after creation.

that later on will be drawn in the folio. QElectroTech allows choosing the color, the type of line 
and the width from the lines. Exists the posibility to choose the properties for main lines and for
