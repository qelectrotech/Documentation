Folio type
==========

To work eficiently and save time, QElectrotech allows defining the type of conductor which will be used 
at the folio. The user can pre-define the properties from all conductors that later on will be created 
inside the folio. This pre-definition avoid defining all properties during conductor creation. 

The **Type** tab from folio properties PopUP window allows defining the type of conductor that later on 
will be drawn at the folio, multiline or Single line, and pre-define the parameters from the conductor.

The figure bellow shows an example of multiline conductor definition where the conductor text is the 
value of the auto numbering variable, the auto numbering pattern is the defined from the project 
conductor list and the conductor voltage is defined as 400 V.
