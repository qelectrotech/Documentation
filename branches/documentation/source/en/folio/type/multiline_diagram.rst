   Figure: Multiline diagram

Unlike single line conductor, the multiline conductor can display text informing about cable number, type of 
cable, nominal current through the cable, cable length, etc. 

At the case of fluid power systems, the main and return line are represented using different graphical lines. 
The pilot lines are also represented at this case. The pipes can indicate some information as pipe number, 
nominal flow, diameter, length, etc.
