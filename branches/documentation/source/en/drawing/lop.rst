Design Local Control Panel (LOP)
================================

QElectroTech is not only a tool for diagrams and shemas, QElectroTech allows also drawing 2D drawings. 
Electrical boxes, buttons, switches, screens and any other type of components can be drawn at the workspace.

2D drawings from electrical component can be created at the element editor from QElectroTech as elements. 
After the creation of component drawings, assembled panel drawings can be created introducing the 
elements at the workspace from QElectroTech. At the category Graphics from the QET collection some common 
electrical components front views are provided as elements.

.. note::

   For more information about how to create elements, please refers to **Create or edit element** section.
   
   For more information about how to introduce element at QElectroTech workspace, please refers to 
   **Working with element** section.

The advantage of drawing control panels using QElectroTech and not with a different CAD tool is the 
posibility to create links between the element. A link between the element which represents the electrical 
component at the schema and the element which represents the component at the drawing will reduce the 
future effort; the effort from the manufacturing, intallation and maintenace phase of the project.
