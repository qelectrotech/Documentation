There is two different ways to manage the activation and hidden of the different opened project from QET, 
the projects can be organized at a project title bar that would be shown at the top from the folio title bar 
or as floating windows that can be displayed or minimized. The managing preferences of the projects can be 
choosed at **Display --> Display projects**.
