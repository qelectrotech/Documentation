All panels that are displayed can be placed at right and left side from the workspace area. 
The panels can also be displayed as a PopUP (floating) windows which the user places where he wants. 
At the case that the user places the panels at the right or left side from the work space area, 
the user can choose if they are organized on column or by tabs.
