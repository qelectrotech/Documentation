The QElectroTech GUI allows having many different `panels`_ switched on to make easier the work 
of the user. 

To display the `panels`_:

    1. Select **Settings > Display** menu item to display the `panels`_ and toolbars list.
    2. Click on the different `panels`_ (Projects, Collections, Undo, Selection properties and Auto Numbering Select) which should be displayed.

All `panels`_ that are displayed can be placed at right and left side from the `Workspace`_. 
The `panels`_ can also be displayed as a PopUP (floating) windows. 

At the case that the user places the `panels`_ at the right or left side from the `Workspace`_, 
the user can choose if they are organized on column or by tabs.

If the user wants to change the organization of the `panels`_, he should only make left click with 
the mouse on the title bar and displace the mouse without releasing the button.
