Design mounting plate
=====================

QElectroTech is not only a tool for diagrams and shemas, QElectroTech allows also drawing 2D drawings. 
Electrical boxes, buttons, switches, screens and any other type of components can be drawn at the 
`workspace`_.

2D drawings from electrical component can be created at the `element editor`_ from QElectroTech as
`elements`_. After the creation of component drawings, assembled panel drawings can be created 
introducing the `elements`_ at the `workspace`_ from QElectroTech. At the category Graphics from 
`QET collection`_ some common electrical components front views are provided as `elements`_.

.. note::

   For more information about how to create `elements`_, please refers to `Create or edit element`_ 
   section.
   
   For more information about how to introduce `elements`_ at QElectroTech `workspace`_, please refers 
   to `Working with element`_ section.

The advantage of drawing mounting plates using QElectroTech and not with a different CAD tool is the 
posibility to create links between the `elements`_. A link between the `elements`_ which represents 
the electrical component at the `schema`_ and the `elements`_ which represents the component at the 
drawing will reduce the future effort; the effort from the manufacturing, intallation and maintenace 
phase of the project.
