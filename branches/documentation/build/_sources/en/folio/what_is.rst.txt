What is a folio?
================

A `folio`_ is part of the `project`_ that can be considered as a unit. It can be the `project index`_, part 
of the `schema`_, the part list complete or partly, etc.

The `folio`_ defines the maximum part of the project information that can be displayed at the same time 
on the `workspace`_, a `folio`_ from a `project`_ is equivalent to a page of a book. When a `project`_ is exported to 
PDF, each `folio`_ is one page from the document. When a `project`_ is exported to any other format (PNG, 
JPG, DXF, etc.), each `folio`_ is one file.

Inside a `project`_, the `folios`_ should have an order. For an easy understanding of the `schema`_, it is 
important that the user takes care about the position and information that is included at each `folio`_.
