=====================
What is a collection?
=====================

At QElectroTech, a title block collection is a database where all title block files are storaged and 
classified. 


QElectroTech has two different title block collections integrated, `QET collection`_ and 
`User collection`_. The title block collections can be found at the `projects panel`_. Bellow a 
figure from the QElectroTech `projects panel`_ is shown.

QElectroTech displays also a third collection when a `project`_ is opened, the `project collection`_. 
This collection is not part from the software structure and it is treated automatically by QElectroTech 
during the folio title block definition.
