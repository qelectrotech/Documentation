What is a folio?
================

A folio is part of the project that can be considered as a unit. It can be the project index, part 
of the schema, the part list complete or partly, etc.

The folio defines the maximum part of the project information that can be displayed at the same time 
on the workspace, a folio from a project is equivalent to a page of a book. When a project is exported to 
PDF, each folio is one page from the document. When a project is exported to any other format (PNG, 
JPG, DXF, etc.), each folio is one file.

Inside a project, the folios should have an orther. For an easy understanding of the schema, it is 
important that the user takes care about the position and information that is included at each folio.
