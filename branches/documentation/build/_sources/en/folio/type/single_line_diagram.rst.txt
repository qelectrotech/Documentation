Single line diagram
=====================

The single line conductor is a simplified notation for representing a two and three phase power system. 
It can also be used to simplify the pressure and return line at fluid pressure systems.

   Figure: Single line diagram

For simple line diagrams, only power lines are represented. The command lines should not be represented at 
single line diagrams. For other side, the connectors are represented without any text information. The main 
idea of single line diagrams is to describe the system minimizing the information. 

At the case of fluid power systems, the main and return line can be represented as two phase system without 
Neutral and Ground. At the single line diagrams the pilot lines should not be represented at the schema.
