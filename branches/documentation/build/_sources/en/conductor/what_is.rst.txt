What is a conductor?
====================

A `conductor`_ or conduit represents the means of transmission of information, electric power, flow 
power (pressure or flow volume) between the source and the target.

At the real life, T-cross are uset at fluid lines and terminal blocks are used to feed different 
electrical devices from the same source. QElectroTech also allows multiple connections between the 
source and the target.

The conductors can be clasified in different families according to the type:

:Multiline:

    `Multiline conductors`_ are used at `multiline diagrams`_ . `Multiline conductors`_ are used for the 
    representation of each terminal, line and phase from two and three phase power systems. 
    `Multiline conductors`_ are used for the individual representation of all electric and control 
    systems.

    At the fluid power schemas, a `multiline conductor`_ represents each line, pressure, return and 
    pilote line.

:Single line:

    The `Single line conductors`_ is used at `single line diagrams`_. `Single line conductors`_ are the 
    simplified notation for representing two and three phase power system drawing using a common 
    `conductor`_. `Single line conductors`_ are only used to represent power systen, control systems 
    are normally not represented.

    At fluid power schemas, the pressure and return line are represented by the same `conductor`_.
