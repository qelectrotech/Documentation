What is a conductor?
====================

A conductor or conduit represents the means of transmission of information, electric power, flow power 
(pressure or flow volume) between the source and the target.

At the real life, T-cross are uset at fluid lines and terminal blocks are used to feed different electrical 
devices from the same source. QElectroTech also allows multiple connections between the source and the 
target.

The conductors can be clasified in different families according to the type of conductor

:Multiline:

    The multiline diagram is the representation of each terminal, line and phase from the two and three 
    phase power systems. The multiline diagram is also used for the representation of all the electric 
    and control systems.

    At the fluid power schemas, a multiline diagram represents the pressure and return line using two 
    different graphical lines.

:Single line:

    The single line diagram is a simplified notation for representing a two and three phase power system 
    drawing only one graphical lines.

    At fluid power schemas, the pressure and return line are represented by the same graphical lines.
