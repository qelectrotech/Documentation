Conductor numbering
====================

QElectroTech allows an automatic codification of `conductors`_. This feature is very usefull for the 
creation of `reports`_, `conductor list`_, and for the identification of `conductors`_ at the physical 
systems and `schemas`_. 

QElectroTech allows the definition of multiples auto numbering patterns. It also provides many 
flexibility on the creation of auto numbering patterns using text, variables and sequential numbers.

.. admonition:: Example

    Taking the content from the image above:
    
    +---+---+----+-----+---+
    | W | X | XX | XXX | N |
    +---+---+----+-----+---+

    :W:
        Code defined by `IEC 81346`_ norm.

            * **W**: Guiding or transporting from one place to another.
    :X:
        Alphanumeric code corresponding to the following coding:

            * H: High voltage
            * B: 400 V AC 
            * C: 230 V AC 
            * D: Digital signal
            * A: Analog signal 
            * @: Network

    :XX:
        Installation or functional unit to which the cable belongs (`schema`_ where the cable can be found).

            * 001: Incoming plant
            * 002: Global auxiliary power
            * 003: Distribution Network
            * 004: instalation 1
            * 005: installation 2
            * ...
            * 999: ...

    :XXX:

        Folio where the cable is represented.
    
    :N:
        Cable number.
