Multiline conductor
====================

The multiline conductor is often used at `Multiline diagrams`_. QElectroTech represents a 
multiline conductor as a simple line. The main difference of multiline with respect to 
`single line conductors`_ is the posibility to display text which is linked to the 
`conductor properties`_.

The main features of multiline conductors are the following:

    1. Posibility to define properties (Function and voltage/protocol)
    2. Text linked to the conductor which can be displaied and its position is relative to the conductor position.
    3. Posibility of displaying variables values at the conductor text (Autonumbering, Function or voltage/protocol).
    4. Posibility of using the conductor variables at `element dynamic text`_ (Function and voltage/protocol).
