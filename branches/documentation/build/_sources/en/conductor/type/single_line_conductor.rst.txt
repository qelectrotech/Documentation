Single line conductor
=====================

The single line conductor is often used at `Single line diagrams`_. QElectroTech represents 
a single line conductor as a simple line with an overlapping symbol which can be costumized. 

QElectroTech does not allow defining any `conductor property`_ at single line conductor. The single line 
conductors do not have the posibility of text linking.
