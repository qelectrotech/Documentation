Project index
=============

A `project`_ can be a group of `folios`_, for this reason the possibility to make index which shows some 
information about the different `folios`_ is necessary. QElectroTech allows creating this index as a 
table in an automatic way. The figure bellow shows how looks the table of folios in QElectroTech.

.. note::

   The list of folios can be created at any time and it will be automatically updated if any 
   `folio`_ is added or deleted. 
   
   It will also be automatically updated if any folio data is changed (ex.: revision, author, date, etc.)
