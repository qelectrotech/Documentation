What is a project?
==================

The term project inside QElecteotech can be assimilated to a "dababase". A project is not a real database,
it is a collection of information which is not structurated in columns and rows. 

A project is a group of folios, elements and connectors represented inside the folios with the respective 
properties, properties which define the way how should be represented each folio (title block, dimensions, 
etc.), properties which define how the reports should be represented (folio index, component list, connector 
list, etc.), properties which define how to export or print the information, interconnection relaction 
between element from the same or different folios and the master data (project name, author, year of 
creation, revision, etc.). 

The project is the base of QElectroTech to manage a work. The development team has focus the tasks on 
the electrical and control filed, even so, QElectroTech is a E-CAE software. For this reason, QElectroTech 
is an inter-disciplinary tool that allows the user to create many type of projects.
