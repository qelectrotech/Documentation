Adding parts to the workspace from the element editor can only be done from the parts tollbar.

   If the toolbar is not displayed, it can be displayed from **Settings > Display > Parts**.

For more information about how to add each type of part (Line, Rectangle, Ellipse, Arc, Polygon, 
Terminal, text and dynamic text field), please refers to the **Element part** section.
