====================
Invert the selection
====================

Some times is easier to select the `parts`_ from the `workspace`_ which are not interested for the 
desired action than the `parts`_ which should be selected. For this reason, QElectroTech provides 
the option to invert the selection.

Inverting the selection can be done from `Menu bar`_ or using the corresponding keyboard shortcut.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    1. `Select the part/s`_ from the opened `element`_ which are not interested for the desired action.
    2. Select **Edit > Invert selection** to invert the selection.
