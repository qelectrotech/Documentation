What is a collection?
=====================

At QElectroTech, an element collection is a database where all element files are storaged and classified. 
The element collection gives the information about element name, element category (folder); element 
sub-categories (sub-folders) and element, category or sub-category path in the file system. 

QElectroTech has two different element collections integrated, QET collection and User collection. Bellow a 
figure from the QElectroTech collections panel is shown.

QElectroTech displays also a third collection when a project is opened, the project collection. This collection 
is not part from the software structure and it is treated automatically by QElectroTech during the draw proces 
from the workspace.
