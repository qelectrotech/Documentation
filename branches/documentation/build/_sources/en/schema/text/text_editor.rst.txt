Text editor
===========

QElectroTech works with text as html code. Even so, the user does not need to take care about the html code. 
Learning html is not necessary to use and add text on the `workspace`_ from QElectroTech.

The text editor from QElectroTech provides the posibility to write and formate text as it looks, like any 
other document tools as LibreOffice Write, and the posiblity to write and formate the text writing html 
code.

Rich text tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Rich text tab from the text editor allows the user writing text as will be displayed at the text box 
and formating the text using different tools from the top toolbar which define the text color, size, 
underline, bold style, italic style, etc.
