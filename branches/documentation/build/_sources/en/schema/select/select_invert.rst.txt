Invert the selection
====================

Some times is easier to select the objects from the `workspace`_ which are not interested for the 
desired action than the objects which should be selected. For this reason, QElectroTech provides 
the option to invert the selection.

Inverting the selection can be done from `Menu bar`_ or using the corresponding keyboard shortcut.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    1.`Select the object/s`_ from the activated `folio`_ which are not interested for the desired action.
    2. Select **Edit > Invert selection** to invert the selection.
