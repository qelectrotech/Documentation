By defaul QElectrotech draws a `conductor`_ minimizing the horizontal and vertical lines. Some times 
is necessary changing the route of the `conductor`_ for a clear understanding of the `schema`_. 
QElectroTech allows modifying the route.

To modify the route of the `conductor`_:

    1. `Select the conductor`_ which route should be modified.
    2. Press on of the control point, blue points, from the `conductor`_ selected.
    3. Without releasing the control point, displace the control point horizontally or vertically until desired position.
