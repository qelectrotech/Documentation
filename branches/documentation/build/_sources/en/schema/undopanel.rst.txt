By one click on one of the actions listed at undo panel, the project will return to the status after the 
action choosed at the panel. While the project is not saved again, the user can go to the different status 
as many times he wants.

.. warning::

    If you play with the panel, be sure that you are at the correct history status before continue working, 
    saving project or any irreversible action like delete folio. Once the project is saved or an 
    irreversible action is made, the history is deleted.

Why can be interested using the Uno panel?

    1. Comming back many steps only with one click.
    2. Recovering an object which was deleted many steps before. The object can be recovered coming back one step before the elimination, copying the object, coming back to the last history status and pasting it.
    3. Checking the project many steps before.
    4. Etc.
