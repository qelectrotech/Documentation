Tooltips
~~~~~~~~

QElectroTech has been designed using the framework and widget toolkit `Qt`_. That election has 
allowed the developers to design the application in a way that a tooltip for each icon of the 
toolbars is displayed when the mouse arrow is placed on the icon. A tooltip is a short message 
which defines the action corresponding to the icon. 

QElectroTech also allows the display from tooltips, or short descrition panels, at many different 
areas and objets that appears at the main window. These panels are not diplayed automatically with 
the placement of the mouse arrow on the object or area. 

    1. Select **Help > What's this?** and press on the object or area to display the panel / object 
    description.
