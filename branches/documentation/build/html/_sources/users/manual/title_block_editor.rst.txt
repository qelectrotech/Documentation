Title block editor
===================================

QElectroTech comes with six different templates to work with, namely - ``A4\_1``, ``default``, ``DIN\_A4``, ``double-logo``, ``ISO7200_A4_V1`` and ``single logo``. QElectroTech also permits custom template designing with user defined title block. The default template loads with a new project, this is the default setting with the QElectroTech. The user can apply a ready to use template from options provided or can also edit a template after it is imported into a drawing, when it appears in the tree - ``embedded title block`` under the project in ``elements panel``. The templates behaviour is much like the actions of other elements, a template can be applied to the current drawing by drag dropping it on to the drawing area from the elements panel. Alternatively, users can also choose a template to load with each new drawing created in a project refer to `information title block`_ of `Section.4`_ . This attribute can be set from the ``project properties`` window with ``new folio`` tab. 
In this section, an introduction to the title block editor is presented. Also, a tutorial to design a referenced title block is included, to familiarize users with the behavior of the title block editor.
