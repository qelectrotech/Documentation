# Qelectrotech-doc

This repo contains the source for the [Qelectrotech (QET)](https://qelectrotech.org/) documentation, generated by the [Sphinx-doc tool](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/fr/master/) to be (almost) always up-to-date for each releases of QET.


This manual is accessible from within the QET app under the "Help > Online Manual" option. An offline mode, in which QET downloads the built HTML file and displays ti in your default browser, is under implementation.

The objective of that repo is that it will be used at some point by the QET devs. Contributions are welcome.
