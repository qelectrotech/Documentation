Export wires
============

QElectroTech allows creating a CSV file which contains a list of all `conductors`_ / wires from the `project`_. 
The CSV file can be opened and edited with tools as `LibreOffice Calc`_.

To export the `conductors`_ / wires list to CSV file:

1. Select **Project > Export the list of names of wires** menu item to open the exporting PopUp window.
2. Choose target directory and file name.
3. Press **Save** button to create the file with extension ``.csv``.
