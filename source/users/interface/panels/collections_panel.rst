To display or hidden the collections panel:

1. Select **Settings > Display > Collections** menu item.

The main function from the collections panel is to manage `elements`_. The tasks 
which can be done from collections panel are:

* Manage `user`_ collection (Create, edit and delete elements from the collection).
* Edit elements from project collection.
* Search elements from the project collection at the `workspace`_.
* Import elements from `QET`_ or `user`_ collection to the project (Add new element to workspace).

To make easier the work with the collections panel, QElectroTech provides a search tool that makes faster 
finding elements inside the different collections.
