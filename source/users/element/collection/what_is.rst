=====================
What is a collection?
=====================

An element collection is a database where all element files are storaged and classified. 
The element collection gives the information about the element name, category (folder); sub-categories 
(sub-folders) and category or sub-category path in the file system. 

QElectroTech has two different element collections integrated, `QET collection`_ and `User collection`_.

QElectroTech displays also a third collection in the `collections panel`_ when a project is opened, the `project collection`_. This collection 
is not part from the software structure and it is treated automatically by QElectroTech during the draw proces 
in the `workspace`_.
