=====================
Single line conductor
=====================

The single line conductors is used at `single line diagrams`_. Single line conductors are the 
simplified notation for representing two and three phase power system drawing using a common 
`conductor`_. Single line conductors are only used to represent power systems, control systems 
are normally not represented.

.. note::

   At fluid power schemas, the pressure and return line are represented by the same `conductor`_.

QElectroTech does not allow defining any `conductor property`_ at single line conductor. The single line 
conductor does not have the posibility of text linking.
