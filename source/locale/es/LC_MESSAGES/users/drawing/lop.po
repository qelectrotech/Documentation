"QElectroTech is not only a tool for diagrams and shemas, QElectroTech "
"allows also drawing 2D drawings. Electrical boxes, buttons, switches, "
"screens and any other type of components can be drawn at the "

"2D drawings from electrical component can be created at the `element "
"editor`_ as `elements`_. After the creation of component drawings, "
"assembled panel drawings can be created introducing the `elements`_ at "
"the `workspace`_. At the category **Graphics** from `QET collection`_ "
"some common electrical components front views are provided as "
"`elements`_."

"The advantage of drawing control panels using QElectroTech and not with a"
" different CAD tool is the posibility to create links between the "
"`elements`_. A link between the `elements`_ which represents the "
"electrical component at the `schema`_ and the `elements`_ which "
"represents the component at the drawing will reduce the future effort; "
"the effort from the manufacturing, intallation and maintenace phase of "
"the project."
