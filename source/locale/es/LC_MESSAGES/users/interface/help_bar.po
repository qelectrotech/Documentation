"The help bar, also known as information bar, is the space below control "
"tabs, the bottom left corner from main window. It is very useful for "
"beginners of QElectroTech in the way that it gives information about the "
"field that is pointed by the cursor. A user can learn about a field by "
"simply pointing it with the mouse and reading the information from help "
"bar."
